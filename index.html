<h1> Scope hoisting </h1>
<p>Historically, JavaScript bundlers have worked by wrapping each module in a function, which is called when the module is imported. This ensures that each module has a separate isolated scope and side effects run at the expected time, and enables development features like <a href="https://nolanlawson.com/2016/08/15/the-cost-of-small-modules/">runtime performance</a><a href="/features/development/#hot-reloading">hot module replacement</a>. However, all of these separate functions have a cost, both in terms of download size and .</p>
<p>In production builds, Parcel concatenates modules into a single scope when possible, rather than wrapping each module in a separate function. This is called <strong>“scope hoisting”.</strong> This helps make minification more effective, and also improves runtime performance by making references between modules static rather than dynamic object lookups.</p>
<p>Parcel also statically analyzes the imports and exports of each module, and removes everything that isn't used. This is called <strong>"tree shaking"</strong> or <strong>"dead code elimination".</strong> Tree shaking is supported for both static and <a href="/features/code-splitting/#tree-shaking">dynamic import</a>, <a href="/languages/javascript/#commonjs">CommonJS</a> and <a href="/languages/javascript/#es-modules">ES modules</a>, and even across languages with <a href="/languages/css/#tree-shaking">CSS modules</a>.</p>
